Description: This package implements the conditional and conjunctional 
  FDR for GWAS summary data described by Andreassen et al. (2013, 
  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003455 ). This approach offers 
  both increased power to detect variants associated with a single trait
  of interest via genetic correlations with a second trait (conditional 
  FDR), and the ability to detect pleiotropic variants for two traits 
  (conjunctional FDR). This is a re-implementation of the general algorithm
  based on the MATLAB code available from https://github.com/precimed/pleiofdr.
